# Architecture Improvements

## Summary of Changes Made

This refactoring improves the Go codebase by implementing proper separation of concerns and following Go best practices:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Removed Global State**
   - Eliminated global variables in `NomadService` that made it non-thread-safe
   - Now uses local data structures passed between methods
   - Proper mutex usage for thread safety

2. **Proper Package Structure**
   - `internal/config`: Configuration loading and validation
   - `internal/server`: HTTP server setup and middleware
   - `internal/handlers`: HTTP request handlers
   - `internal/domain`: Business models, interfaces, and custom errors
   - `internal/api/v1`: Business logic and service implementations

3. **Clean Dependency Injection**
   - Dependencies are properly created and injected in main()
   - No global variables for configuration
   - Clear interfaces for testing and modularity

4. **Better Error Handling**
   - Custom error types in domain package
   - Proper error wrapping and context
   - Structured error responses

5. **Go Idioms**
   - Proper interface definitions
   - Context usage where appropriate
   - Error handling patterns
   - Package naming and organization

### Maintained Functionality:
- All existing API endpoints work the same
- Configuration loading works identically
- Authentication mechanisms unchanged  
- Static file serving preserved
- OpenAPI specification serving maintained

The code is now more maintainable, testable, and follows Go conventions while preserving all existing functionality.
